Neon Nexus is a state-of-the-art monitoring system designed for the next generation of smart cities. It aggregates data from thousands of IoT sensors and visualizes it in a real-time 3D environment.

Designed with a focus on **situational awareness** and **rapid response**, the dashboard provides operators with a god's-eye view of the city's infrastructure grid.
